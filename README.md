# RoadCrossingGame
We as a team of two, have developed a Road Crossing Game using OpenGL library in C++ which simulates the challenge of crossing a busy road while avoiding oncoming traffic. The objective is for the player's character to safely traverse a multi-lane road by moving up, down, left, and right to avoid collisions with moving vehicles.
